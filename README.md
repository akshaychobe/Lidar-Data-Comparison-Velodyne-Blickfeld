# Lidar-Data-Comparison-Velodyne-Blickfeld

This repository contains the code and resources for a project on comparing lidar data from Velodyne Puck and Blickfeld Cube 1 sensors.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to measure and compare the data from Velodyne Puck and Blickfeld Cube 1 lidar sensors, and to plot a graph of the distance versus the number of points inside the bounding box for each sensor.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or later
* NumPy 1.20 or later
* Matplotlib 3.4 or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Lidar-Data-Comparison.git`
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Running the Code

1. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset of lidar data from Velodyne Puck and Blickfeld Cube 1 sensors.

## Code Structure

### Folders

* `code/`: Contains Python code for data processing, plotting, and analysis
* `data/`: Stores the lidar data from Velodyne Puck and Blickfeld Cube 1 sensors
* `results/`: Stores the plots and results of the analysis

### Files

* `main.py`: Python script that executes the data processing, plotting, and analysis
* `data_processing.py`: Python script that processes the lidar data
* `plotting.py`: Python script that plots the graphs of distance versus number of points
* `analysis.py`: Python script that performs the analysis of the results

## Results

The project produces the following results:

* Plots of distance versus number of points for Velodyne Puck and Blickfeld Cube 1 sensors
* Analysis of the results, including comparison of the two sensors
