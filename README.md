# Lidar-Data-Comparison-Velodyne-Blickfeld

This repository contains the code and resources for a project on comparing lidar data from Velodyne Puck and Blickfeld Cube 1 sensors.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to measure and compare the data from Velodyne Puck and Blickfeld Cube 1 lidar sensors, and to plot a graph of the distance versus the number of points inside the bounding box for each sensor.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or later
* NumPy 1.20 or later
* Matplotlib 3.4 or later

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset of lidar data from Velodyne Puck and Blickfeld Cube 1 sensors.

## Code Structure

### Files

* `code.py`: Contains Python code for data processing, plotting, and analysis
* `dataset`: Stores the lidar data from Velodyne Puck and Blickfeld Cube 1 sensors


## Results

The project produces the following results:

* Plots of distance versus number of points for Velodyne Puck and Blickfeld Cube 1 sensors
* Analysis of the results, including comparison of the two sensors
